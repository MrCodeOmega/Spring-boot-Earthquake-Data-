# Spring boot Earthquake Data Fetch 
## Earthquake data fetch with Spring boot and React

###### **Summary**

In this project you can list earthquakes by time

Project listen default port (:8080) 

You can see data only web side console ( localhost:8080)
>You cannot see any data in **react** if you dont run spring project first.

## I'm new at spring boot so i could only fetch data with start and end time
> The main reason this, the endpoint dosent contain "country" or any parameters so you can only give date time 

**But I wanted to try best and I connected spring boot project with react and this way it can show country and time for earthquakes now.

## Thank you for coming here and reading all of these. Have a nice day :)
